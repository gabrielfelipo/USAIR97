# USAIR97 Project
![banner](./Banner.png)

## Description
  This was a project for the Algorithms and Data Structures chair, in this project it was necessary to find a problem that can be modeled using Graphs. I selected a database of flights between American airports in 1997. The challenge was using the Djkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two airports and the flight distance.
  I used streamlit to make the screen where it would be possible to select two airports and I used the Djkstra algorithm made in python language to calculate what was necessary.
  
## Used Technologies
- Python
- Streamlit
